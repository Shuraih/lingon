# orangejuice 

A minimalistic static site generator inspired by Middleman and Sprockets, compatible with some gulp plugins.

## Overview
This project is an attempt to port some of the features of [middleman](http://middlemanapp.com) to the node.js ecosystem. If you already love middleman and Sprockets but want/need to use node.js, this might be interesting to you.

The project is currently very experimental, use it for fun not profit.

## Examples
